# Welcome!

I'm Ken Muse, a Senior DevOps Architect on the GitHub Fast Track team.

I'm a 4-time Azure MVP, a Microsoft Certified Trainer, an ALM | DevOps Ranger, and a member of the Microsoft Azure Advisors. I've spent my career doing a bit of everything: 
- 🌐 Developing highly scalable platforms and global-scale architectures, especially using Azure
- 😱 Coding in tons of different languages, including C/C++, C#, Java, .NET, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Scala, and PHP. 
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Helping companies of all sizes to build and mature a culture of DevOps and craft cloud solutions. 
- 🗣️ Community speaking: All Day DevOps, Devops World, Global Azure, SQL Saturday ...
- 🎵 I'm a musician! I enjoy playing multiple instruments and composing.

I'm always glad to help people learn more about the world of technology. We all have to start somewhere, right?
